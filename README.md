## Patricia Garcia Nieto 

Curious and creative human, avid learner, veterinary surgeon, and software developer on the making. 

I considered moving countries one of the most challenging things I had ever done, until I decided to  switch careers into IT and found myself starting all over again once more, but life would be so boring without a good challenge, wouldn’t it?

Although I had made some basic websites on HTML as a teenager as a hobby, for some reason I had never pictured software and web developing as something I could do as a job. Two years ago, I started playing with Python a couple of years ago during my spare time and realised it was something I actually enjoyed doing. Since then, I have learnt basic Python and Ruby and enrolled in the Makers Academy bootcamp in order to become a Software Developer.

I have found in tech what I always looked for: lots of situations that can be dealt with using problem solving and a good amount of creativity, unlimited chances for drinking tea and the fact that I can make my own video-games, yay!

## Work experience

**Steamship circus** (August 2022 - current)

_Circus artist_
* Work as a performer doing walkabouts.
* Currently training to become a fire-performer (dragon staff and fire fans).

**Vets4Pets Poole** (May 2021 – June 2022)

_Veterinary surgeon_
* Consultations, diagnostics and soft tissue surgery. Lead ultrasonographer.
* Working in this practice helped me improve my problem-solving abilities when dealing with complicated clinical cases, as well as coming up with creative solutions by thinking outside the box. As an example, unlike the rest of my colleagues, I was very keen in using local-anaesthetics for simple surgeries when a general anaesthesia imposed a risk to the patient, like in a 2 week old puppy that had a congenital defect.

**Natterjacks vet** (February 2019 – March 2021)

_Veterinary surgeon_
* Consultations, diagnostics and soft tissue surgery. Lead ultrasonographer.
* This job helped me improve my time-management even when we were under time pressure or needing to multitask.
* I also found a love in working within a large team, in where being a colleague was a synonym of a friend and where we would all care for each other and help each other thrive.

**Centro Veterinario Cania** (June 2015 – October 2016 and October 2017 – January 2019)

_Sole charge Veterinary surgeon_
* Consultations, diagnostics and soft tissue surgery. Lead ultrasonographer. 
* This practice and its owner gave me my first job opportunity and taught me what being responsible of a business meant, as well as improving my self-confidence when working unsupervised, having to trust my own knowledge and abilities.
* We did a lot of charity work aided by residents of the area for the stray cat colonies. I found the possibility of helping the community and animals in need extremely rewarding and it allowed me to meet some wonderful people. 

**Lockwood Animal Hospital, CV Antartida, CV los Juncos, Briar hourse vets** (May 2017 - September 2018)

_Locum Veterinary surgeon_
* Consultations, diagnostics and soft tissue surgery in different practices both across Spain and the UK.
* I enjoyed exploring a variety of ways to work and it helped me to learn how to thrive independently of the circumstances around me.

**Serendipia – Rock band** (October 2015 – 2018)

_Lead singer_
* Performed at several pubs and festivities.
* This position required a lot of team-work, creativity and organisation but was also very good fun.


## Skills

### Team worker and good communicator
I love meeting new people, getting to know their stories and creating meaningful relationships. I also enjoy creating a safe and comfortable space for the people around me, where communication and emotional intelligence are the key to achieving an environment where everyone feels respected, valued and appreciated. I am also happy to act as a mediator if the situation arises and enjoy mentoring or leading where appropriate. 

Although I work very well independently and I am capable to stay focused and motivated, I prefer to do so within a team, where people with different ideas and perspectives are able to come to a much more balanced solution to a problem. 

### Problem-solving and high attention to detail
If you think about it, being a veterinary surgeon is not that different from being a software developer, which means I have over six years of experience in problem solving under my belt. In both cases, you are presented with a list of problems you have to try find a solution for and, often, coming up with this solution requires a lot of thinking, studying, asking other people, looking for small details, thinking outside the box and practising trial and error. You want to focus on solving each individual problem but keeping in mind the bigger picture.

For example, once I got presented with an elderly cat that, according to the owner, was eating better than ever and seemed generally well in himself, although he wasn’t putting any weight on despite emptying two bowls of food a day. I suspected something wasn’t quite right and obtained permission to take bloods, which revealed an onset of a hyperactive thyroid. From there, we developed a plan of action to get this cat back in track before any more concerning health issues developed due to this.

### Quick-learner

Learning new things and challenging myself is what keeps me motivated! In my previous roles I have had to try and learn lots of surgeries from only seeing them done once and then replicate the process, as well as improve my techniques with practice and studying.

### Broad experience in customer-facing roles

Customer-facing isn’t always easy and most people know that, but it is all about appearing confident and communicating clearly, about letting the client know that you are there to help them and will do as much as you can so that they are satisfied, but also about setting your own boundaries with them.

During my working years I have encountered all sorts of customers. Some were lovely and would bring me chocolates for helping their beloved dog or cat, in some exceptional cases, some would be distrustful or disrespectful, but to all of them I was always professional and tried to make them leave with the sense that we had done the best we could for their pets. I always felt very proud when clients requested me personally for their consultations!


## Education

#### Makers Academy (September 2022 – December 2022) 
- Currently doing Makers Academy software development bootcamp
- Using daily pairing sessions in order to problem solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and good communication.
- Until this moment, we have covered the basics of Ruby and TDD (RSpec).

#### Masters in High school Sciences teaching (Catholic University of Murcia, Spain, 2017)
* This masters helped me understand how learning works and what the best techniques for teaching and explaining are, which I found very interesting.
* I did a placement after my Masters and realised that, as much as I loved learning and teaching, working with teenagers wasn’t for me and decided to continue with my career as a veterinary surgeon.

#### Degree in Veterinary Medicine (University of Murcia, Spain. 2009 –  2015)
* Mean qualifications 8.3/10, nine of the core subjects passed with distinctions.
* Intensification in Medicine and surgery.
* Intern student in the Anaesthesia department.


## Other qualifications

* GPCert in Small Animal Surgery (December 2019 – September 2022)

* Advanced level of spoken and written English (Spanish School of languages – 2016)

* Advanced level of spoken and written English (Cambridge Advanced Exam – 2015)

* Basic German and French (level A2)

## Hobbies

I am very glad you have made it this far, because this is my favourite part of all!. I am not too sure of where to start though...

I love being creative, and that includes writing (whether it is on my [blog](https://www.catfromspace.com), on my diary or the odd poem), drawing and painting (you have a link to my deviantart [here](https://www.deviantart.com/the-horse-rider)), woodburning, doing crochet or crossed-stitch, photography… I am always excited about trying some new form of craft.

Music is another one of my passions, I love singing and have recorded several self-produced albums  with my father, as well as composed some songs myself and was part of a rock band. I will attend to as many gigs as I can, both in small pubs or large venues, and enjoy going to a few festivals during the summer time.

I also enjoy being active:
* I am currently doing a walking/running/cycling Lord of the Rings themed challenge (because fantasy and reading are also my thing), around 3000km in total. I particularly love hiking in nature or walking along the shore.
* Weekly yoga sessions also helps keeping my body and my mind healthy.
* I have recently picked-up on aerial hoop which is allowing me to gain core strength and it is also a lot of fun!
* I am also learning to be a fire-performer (currently learning dragon staff and fire-fans) and enjoying regular jams to spin and learn from other people.

One of my dreams if being able to travel everywhere, maybe even one day working from a campervan, in a different country every fortnight. I love discovering new cultures, architecture, ways of life and gastronomy. I am currently saving to travel to Thailand, Japan and New Zealand, whilst trying to do some trips to Europe every year.
